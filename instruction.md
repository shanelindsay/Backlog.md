# Installing Backlog.md CLI in the Codex environment

The CLI is distributed via npm and works with both Bun and Node.js.

1. **Install using Bun**

   ```bash
   bun add -g backlog.md@0.3.3
   ```

2. **Install using npm**

   ```bash
   npm install -g backlog.md@0.3.3
   ```

3. **Verify the installation**

   ```bash
   backlog --version
   ```
   You should see `0.3.3` as the output.

Once installed, you can run `backlog` commands from any repository.
